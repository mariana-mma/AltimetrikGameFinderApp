# Altimetrik Game Finder Application
Final project of Altimetrik's Bootcamp BEFEDA 2022, a game finder application, made by Mariana Mostarda.
This app is connected to the https://rawg.io/ API, which brings information about many videogames.
The server used for the login validation is the https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server-auth.
It was made using HTML, SASS and Vanilla JavaScript.

**To run JSON Server Auth, use the following command:**
```
npm run json-server
```

**Current functionality:**
Once you login you can search the name of any game you want, after pressing 'ENTER' the card with the information will show up. 
Try changing the display from three cards to one, and you'll get a description of the game!
